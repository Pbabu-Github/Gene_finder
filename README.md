# Gene_finder
This is a gene-finding algorithm that identifies potential genes in DNA sequences using ORF prediction. The program detects start and stop codons, extracts ORFs, and analyzes both forward and reverse reading frames, enhancing the likelihood of identifying functional genes on both DNA strands.
